            Hi {{adopter.user_profile.first_name}},
        </p>
    </div>
    <div>
        <p>
            We're excited to let you know that your Saving Grace adoption request has been reviewed and approved! Now it's time to book your appointment. Please take a moment to read through the following information to ensure a smooth and positive experience for both you and the dog.
        </p>
        <!-- LIVES WITH PARENTS BLOCK -->
        {% if adopter.lives_with_parents %}
            <p>
                You mentioned in your application that you live with your parents or guardians. As part of our policy, at least one parent must attend the appointment with you. While you have the final say in choosing the dog, we want to ensure that the homeowner is on board with the decision. This requirement does not apply if you own your home. We also recommend, though it's not mandatory, that you bring all household members to the appointment. Since the dog will be living with them, it's important they feel comfortable with the choice.
            </p>
        {% endif %}
        <!-- OUT OF STATE BLOCK -->
        {% if adopter.user_profile.out_of_state %}
            <p>
                You've indicated that you're located outside of North Carolina, South Carolina, or Virginia. We are happy to assist out-of-state adopters, and we'd like to clarify the process for long-distance adoptions.
            </p>
            <p>
                We do not offer shipping or transport for adopted dogs. Each adopter <strong>must</strong> meet the dog in person before finalizing the adoption. To ensure that as many dogs as possible find their forever homes, <strong>we do not place dogs on hold.</strong> This means that a dog you're interested in may be adopted by someone else before your visit. It's best to come with an open mind and choose a dog in person that feels like the right match for you.
            </p>
            <p>
                If a dog has not yet completed their veterinary care, you may need to return for a second visit to finalize the adoption. We suggest you check with a local veterinarian in your state about the health certificate or licensing requirements for bringing a new dog into your area. It's your responsibility to obtain the health certificate from a North Carolina veterinarian, though we are happy to recommend veterinarians if needed.
            </p>

    <!-- MAKING AN APPOINTMENT -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Making an Appointment</h2>
        <p>
            Appointments can be scheduled up to two weeks in advance. We ask that all adopters be fully prepared to take a dog home immediately after the appointment. Please note that <strong>we do not hold dogs</strong> unless they require further veterinary care.
        </p>
        <p class="bold">
            <strong>If you have upcoming travel and are concerned about disrupting your new pet's adjustment period, please schedule your appointment for after your return.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you don't find a match on your first visit, you are welcome to schedule follow-up appointments until you do.
        </p>
        <p>
            Adopting a dog is a significant decision. To ensure the best possible outcome for both you and the dog, we require that adopters personally attend the appointment and make the selection themselves.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>To make your appointment, visit our volunteer-managed scheduling portal at <a href="savinggracencscheduler.com" target="_blank">www.savinggracencscheduler.com</a>. Keep your email open! You'll need to check it again for a one-time passcode. If you don't see it come within 2 minutes, check your junk and spam folders and see if your passcode was sent there.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            We schedule appointments up to two weeks in advance. If you're planning ahead, your application will remain on file for up to one year after approval. The only follow-up action required is to respond to this email when you're ready to schedule.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- AVAILABILITY OF DOGS -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Availability of Dogs</h2>
        <p>
            Appointments typically last about an hour, during which you will meet several dogs available at that time. Any dog listed on our website is currently available, and if a dog is no longer listed, they have already found their new home.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Our dogs are available on a first-come, first-served basis. We do not hold dogs for specific appointments. Having an appointment does not guarantee that any specific dog will be available for you to meet.</strong> Unfortunately, due to volunteer capacity, we are unable to track requests or wishlists by email.
        </p>
        <p>
            The more flexible you are during your visit, the more opportunities you'll have to find the right match. You're welcome to monitor our website before your visit, as we try to update it daily. Keep in mind that we often have more dogs available than are listed online, so a visit is always a good idea.
        </p>
        <p>
            While email is our preferred method for communicating policies, the best way to inquire about specific dogs is to speak directly with the counselor you meet during your appointment. We generally do not recommend dogs ahead of your visit.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're interested in PUPPIES (up to around 5 months old), they typically arrive on Wednesdays. If a puppy's bio lists a specific date, that's the day they become available. They must be adopted the same day they are made available and cannot be picked up at a later date. Please note, we cannot guarantee the size of puppies as we do not know their father's identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you're looking for SMALL ADULTS (under 20 lbs), please plan to schedule your visit on a Friday or Saturday, as these dogs are cared for in foster homes and only available for appointments on these days.
        </p>
        <p>
            We do not offer trial adoptions. You may have heard of our Host Weekend program, which allows some of our long-term residents to enjoy a break from the shelter. While it's not a trial adoption, Host Weekend is a great way to see if dog ownership is the right fit for you. Please note, requests for specific dogs cannot be honored for Host Weekend.
        </p>

    <div class="subsection">

    <!-- CONTACTING US -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Contacting Us</h2>
        <p>
            Our Adoptions Team is busy interacting with dogs and adopters during operating hours. Email is the best way to stay in touch with us, as our phone line is not actively monitored. Several volunteers assist in managing email communication, which helps ensure that we are all on the same page and can provide timely responses.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- OPERATING HOURS -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Operating Hours</h2>
        <p>
            Saving Grace is located on a private property. Adoption appointments are only available during our operating hours:
        </p>
        <p>
            Mondays, Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Fridays - noon to 6pm<br />

        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- GETTING READY FOR YOUR APPOINTMENT -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Getting Ready for Your Appointment</h2>
        <p>
            We encourage you to bring all members of your household who will be involved in the dog's care, including children, roommates, or spouses. It's particularly important that children attend, as they can be unpredictable, and the dog should feel comfortable with everyone in the household. Some dogs may not be compatible with young children, so it's best to make this a family decision.
        </p>
        <p>
            You're welcome to bring your current dog, but please note that we do not have off-leash areas for meet-and-greets. All introductions will take place on leash in the parking lot. During warmer weather, your dog will need to wait in the parking lot with a family member. If it's cool enough, your dog may wait in your car while you meet potential new pets. Please let us know in advance if you plan to bring your dog so we can make preparations.
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- OUTCOMES AND FEES -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Adoption Outcomes and Fees</h2>
        <p>
            The adoption fee is $395, and we accept cash or credit/debit cards (we do not accept checks or split payments). Please bring a valid ID. We recommend bringing exact cash unless you wish to make a donation, as we do not keep change on-site.
        </p>
        <p>
            You are under no obligation to adopt during your visit, but if you decide to proceed, here are the three possible outcomes:
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <strong>ADOPTABLE: </strong>If the dog is ready for adoption, you may take them home the same day.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>FOSTER TO ADOPT (FTA Program): </strong>If the dog is heartworm-positive, they will go home with you as a foster until treatment is completed. Final adoption will take place after the third treatment, usually within 8-10 weeks.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>RESERVED/CHOSEN: </strong>Some dogs may require additional veterinary care before they are ready for adoption. These dogs are "chosen" and will not be available for other adopters until they are cleared.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </div>
    <!-- PARTNERSHIPS -->
    <div class="subsection">
        <h2>Partnerships</h2>
        <p>
            We are proud to partner with Boehringer-Ingelheim (BI), who offers a free preventative care program for adopted dogs. BI will contact you after adoption with more information about their services, and you will have the option to opt out of future communications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, we use a private scheduling program owned and created by one of our volunteers. Your application data will be stored securely in the database and used solely for scheduling purposes.
